            According to the Department and Social Affairs of the United Nations, there is a lack of environmental accessibility faced by people with disability in many cities in the world. With opportunities in Urban Development programs, there is an opportunity have accessibility and inclusiveness in urban environment. This change start with us, by bringing about an awareness. 
            <br>
            The purpose of this web application is assist those who wants to enjoy public spaces that provide accommodations and accessibility for people with disabilities. Our belief is that all should have same opportunity to enjoy common spaces by promoting inclusiveness and integration in communities for family of or people with disabilities.  We hope this application will provide such opportunities and increase accessibility where there is none, by bringing about awareness to create such space in locations that need these facilities.
